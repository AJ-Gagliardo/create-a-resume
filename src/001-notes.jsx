      List of things to do Identify which components i need Do a simple test on
      one of those components see which things i can replicate
    </>
  );
}

// General idea would be having on the left the inputs and on the right the output on real time using react and state

// break everyhing up in components
// maybe can do a general input function , example function Input(){}  and then insert that function in ever other function , example function ComponentOne(){Input()}
//then <root><Component1><component2> so they can be in order and if user dont insert anything , nothing will appear
